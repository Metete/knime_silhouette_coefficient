    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Silhouette refers to a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data. The technique provides a succinct numerical representation of how well each object lies within its cluster.
			   The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from âˆ’1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.
			   If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters.
			   In this implementation the silhouette is calculated with the Euclidean distance.
